Three different ways of talking about the world 

We collected the articles belonging to three categories (for ENTER date range): 
- History of Sports
- History of Ideologies
- History of Objects

For each category, we collect data 5 layers deep (on that categories page, not the wikipedia article pages)
For example, everything under history of objects 5 layers deep.
